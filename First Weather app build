# Weather-App
This is a Weather App I attempted to builld from watching and following the Tutorial of Tyler Potts in - Build a Weather app using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript in 2020.
I coded the weather app using Visual Studio Code and used HTML, CSS and Vanilla Java Script.  

Please feel free to add new features and advise me on what else i could build to practice these fun projects.
